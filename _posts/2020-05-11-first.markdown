This blog place will log my encounter of rabbit holes and mildly interesting topics in scientific publications that are fascinating, but sadly I don't feel that engaged to dive in. I'll try to only provide subjective commenting when a) I have some knowledge about the topic and know what I'm saying, or b) the comments are compeltely not scientific.
